              Due to the ban on plastic bags, the attention is shifting to other
              alternatives such as baskets which are processed from reeds. Other
              products which are made of raw materials sourced by forests are
              purses, mats, traps and small furniture. Wicker weaving is the
              process of making furniture out of Rattan, cane or Reeds. Rattan
              is basically the thin, flexible stems sourced from old world
              climbing palm trees. Raffia is a strong and durable, soft and
              pliable, and easy to dye material used in weaving baskets, mats,
              rugs or setting up floral arrangements.

              Honey is a major food product sourced from forests. The
              communities which live next to the forest are the big sellers of
              honey. Then companies source that honey from them and get it to
              us! A great example would be this bottle of honey I love to use!
              Many governments give permission to villagers and communities to
              carry out commercial honey farming on nearby forests as long as
              they do not harm the forest. This improves the local economy and
              complete satisfaction of the customer.

              Palm oil production is very common. Its the main economic activity
              for communities living around palm trees. Although these trees are
              grown by the farmers, the communities also share the oil produce
              extracted from the palm forests
